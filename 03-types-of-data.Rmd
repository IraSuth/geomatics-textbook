# Types of Data {#types-of-data}

**Data Types**, Any entity we wish to represent in a Geographic Information System can be described with three pieces of information What, When, and Where?  In the previous chapter, we introduced how to represent the where on the earth an entity occurs inside a GIS.  In this chapter we will introduce how we can describe what an entity is or when it occurs.  Then we will cover how we use spatial data models to link the what and when to the where using spatial data models.  Then we will wrap up by introducing some of the specific file types we use in GIS to represent spatial data.

### Key Terms {-}

Attribute, Qualitative, Quantitative, Vector, Raster




## Attribute Data

Spatial data is the foundation of Geographic Information Science, but spatial coordinates are meaningless unless they are linked with descriptive information about the location.  Any non-spatial data relating to a spatial entity is known as an attribute.  This non-spatial data can broadly be classified as either qualitative or quantitative.  Data that is strictly descriptive and lacks any numeric quantity is qualitative.  Data with numerical values that are separated by some meaningful interval is quantitative.  The types of analysis we can conduct with qualitative data is more limited than quantitative data, but that does not necessarily mean quantitative is "better" than qualitative.

Should I have subsections to introduce quantitative vs. qualitative?

### Nominal

Qualitative data that just consists of a name/category with no ranking or direction is known as Nominal data.  One category is not more or less, better or worse than another, they are just different.  A good example would be flower types (see fig).  Other examples would be zoning categories, colors, flavors of ice cream, place names, etc.  The only arithmetic operations we can do with nominal data are checking for equality (True/False), count occurrences, and calculate the mode (most frequent occurrence).

### Ordinal

Qualitative that has some sort of ranking, but no numerical scale associated with that ranking is known as Ordinal.  A good example would be relative sizes (see fig).  We can see Yarrow is taller than her sister Shamsa, so we can rank these dogs by height.  However, we haven't measured their heights, so we don't know how much taller Yarrow is than Shamsa.  Some other good examples of Ordinal data include  spice levels (mild, medium, hot), residential zoning density (low, medium, high), and survey responses.  With ordinal data, we can do all operations we can do with nominal data, plus a few more.  We can check the order/rank (greater than, less than) and in some circumstances we can calculate the median (see figure).

### Graded membership
 ... necessary?  Related to ambiguity, is this the right place to talk about it??


### Interval
Quantitative data on a fixed scale but with an arbitrary zero point is known as interval data.  A good example of this type of data is temperature in degrees Celsius.  
* Time (3PM)
* Dates (2021)
* Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
  * 20 ÀöC is not ‚Äútwice as warm‚Äù as 10 Àö
    * 293.15 ÀöK vs as 283.15 ÀöK
    * 200 ÀöK is "twice as warm" as 100 ÀöK

Might be better to introduce ratio first?

![My own images, can update text/font/styling as necessary.  Very rough draft](images/03-interval-temperature.png){.center}

Log-Interval was listed - is it necessary?  I don't think it needs its own section?

### Ratio
Quantitative data with an absolute zero point (no negative value).  A good example of this type of data is population (see figure).  A population of 200 is 2x a population of 100.  Other examples are, temperature (in Kelvin), precipitation, height, income, rental cost.  With ratio data we can do any kind of arithmetic operation.  Add/subtract, multiply/divide, along with calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median).  

(Figure idea) - population map or simple chart with stick figures highlighting population counts.


What are these: Extensive Ratio, Cyclical Ratio, Derived Ratio (normalization?)
I think all these can just be lumped in with Ratio Above^

### Counts
 .... this is more an operation?  Can be done to any data type?  I don't think it merits its own section.
#### Absolute
????


## Spatial data models
### Vector data

Vectors use points, lines, and polygons to represent objects
Data attributes are stored in a separate database table and linked using simple identification numbers
 

![https://www.oercommons.org/courses/introduction-to-geospatial-concepts/view - might be easier to recreate our own if the logo is an issue?](images/03-vector-example.png){.center}
 

#### Points
Points are ‚Äúzero-dimensional‚Äù:
They don‚Äôt have length, width, or height in the system
Points have an (ùíô,ùíö) coordinate pair describing their location

![Very rough draft.](images/03-vector-points.png){.center}

#### Lines
Lines are one-dimensional:
They have length, but no width or height
Lines have at least two points, a beginning point and an end point
Lines may also have any number of middle points, called vertices


![I'll make something similar for lines.](images/03-vector-points.png){.center}

#### Polygons
Polygons are two-dimensional:
They may have length and width
Polygons have at least three points
The beginning and end points must be the same 
Polygons have straight or curved line segments, sometimes called ‚Äúedges‚Äù


![I'll make something similar for polygons.](images/03-vector-points.png){.center}

#### Tabular Data (Attributes)
Information about a point, line, or area
Only one data type per column
Data type limits what kind and how much information 
Text
Numeric: Float/Double, Long/Short Integer
Object 
One entry per cell
Rows are distinct
Null values possible


![Simple diagram from my lecture notes, I can recreate a better one if needed.](images/03-vector-attributes.png){.center}

### Raster data
Space represented with a grid of equally sized pixels/grid cells.
A single value is assigned to each cell
In GIS, rasters are most commonly encountered as:
Satellite imagery
Drone imagery
Elevation models
Bathymetric models
Scanned maps

Numeric data value assigned to each grid cell at each location, corresponding to the entity being modelled. 
Typically used to represent surfaces, since every grid cell is assigned a data value.


Multiple layers can be combined
Each layer represents a different field
Raster Math:
Layers can be combined with expressions get new information
A = Average July Temperature
B = Average January Temperature
C = A ‚Äì B
Average Temperature Range

### Triangulated Irregular Networks
Are these worth more than a passing mention?

#### Police Involved Deaths in Canada {#box-text -}

<p id="box-text">I'll fill this in later. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/PoliceInvolvedDeathsInCanada">link</a> to the github org where I'll be hosting the data.  I'll give an interactive map & a brief discussion the data types used (nominal) ratio (police involved death rate and how they can be used together.  I think this is a good example of how qualitative data and descriptor can be very useful.  But its also super depressing.</p>

## How is Data Represented in a Computer
Before we talk about the different types of data, lets briefly discuss how information is represented inside a computer, the

### Bits & Bytes
Bits are singluar pieces of information, representing 1's and 0's.  A circut is either on or off.  The next step up from that, is the byte.  "The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures." - copy pasta from Wikipedia

### Types of Numbers
Integer vs. Floating-point  Discreet vs. Continuous

### Other types of information
Text, Boolean, Dates


## Common file types
### Shapefile (.shp)
### Geodatabase (.gdb)
This isn't really a file type?  Might this go better in chapter 5?

### LAS (.las)
### Comma Separated Values (.csv)
### GPS data (.gpx)
### Keyhole Markup Language (.kml)
### ASCII images (.asc)
### ENVI-format images (.dat)
### GeoTiff images (.tif)
