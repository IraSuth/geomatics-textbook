# Types of Data {#types-of-data}

**Data Types**, Any entity we wish to represent in a Geographic Information System can be described with three pieces of information What, When, and Where?  In the previous chapter, we introduced how to represent the where on the earth an entity occurs inside a GIS.  In this chapter we will introduce how we can describe what an entity is and when it occurs.  Then we will cover how we use spatial data models to link the what and when to the where using spatial data models.  Then we will wrap up by introducing some of the specific file types we use in GIS to represent spatial data.

### Key Terms {-}

Attribute, Qualitative, Quantitative, Vector, Raster


## Attribute Data

Spatial data is the foundation of Geographic Information Science, but spatial coordinates are meaningless unless they are linked with descriptive information about the location.  Any non-spatial data relating to a spatial entity is known as an attribute.  This non-spatial data can broadly be classified as either qualitative or quantitative.  Data that is strictly descriptive and lacks any numeric quantity is qualitative.  Data with numerical values that are separated by some meaningful interval is quantitative.  The types of analysis we can conduct with qualitative data is more limited than quantitative data, but that does not necessarily mean quantitative is "better" than qualitative.

### Nominal

Quantitative data that just consists of a name/category with no ranking or direction is known as Nominal data.  One category is not more or less, better or worse than another, they are just different.  A good example would be flower types (see fig).  Other examples would be zoning categories, colors, flavors of ice cream, place names, etc.  The only arithmetic operations we can do with nominal data are checking for equality (True/False), count occurrences, and calculate the mode (most frequent occurrence).

### Ordinal

Quantitative that has some sort of ranking, but no numerical scale associated with that ranking is known as Ordinal.  A good example would be relative sizes (see fig).  We can see Yarrow is taller than her sister Shamsa, so we can rank these dogs by height.  However, we haven't measured their heights, so we don't know how much taller Yarrow is than Shamsa.  Some other good examples of Ordinal data include  spice levels (mild, medium, hot), residential zoning density (low, medium, high), and survey responses.  With ordinal data, we can do all operations we can do with nominal data, plus a few more.  We can check the order/rank (greater than, less than) and in some circumstances we can calculate the median (see figure).

### Graded membership
 ... necessary?  Related to ambiguity, is this the right place to talk about it??

## Quantitative

### Interval
Numeric data on a fixed scale but with an arbitrary zero point is known as interval data.  A good example of this type of data is temperature in degrees Celsius.  
* Time (3PM)
* Dates (2021)
* Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
  * 20 ˚C is not “twice as warm” as 10 ˚

### Log-Interval
 ... necessary?  

### Ratio
Numeric data with an absolute zero point (no negative value).  A good example of this type of data is population (see figure).  Other examples are, temperature (in Kelvin), precipitation, height, income, rental cost.


### Extensive Ratio
### Cyclical Ratio
### Derived Ratio
I think all these can just be lumped in with Ratio Above^

### Counts
 .... this is more an operation?  Can be done to any data type?  I don't think it merits its own section.
#### Absolute
????

## How is Data Represented in a Computer
This might be better for the start of the chapter?
### Bits & Bytes
Bits are singluar pieces of information, representing 1's and 0's.  A circut is either on or off.  The next step up from that, is the byte.  "The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures." - copy pasta from Wikipedia

### Types of Numbers
Integer vs. Floating-point  Discreet vs. Continuous

### Other types of information
Text, Boolean, Dates

## Spatial data models
### Vector data
#### Points
#### Lines
#### Polygons
#### Attributes

### Raster data
#### Cell data
#### Digital numbers

### Triangulated Irregular Networks
Are these worth more than a passing mention?


#### Case Study {-}

#### Police Involved Deaths in Canada {#box-text -}

<p id="box-text">I'll fill this in later. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/PoliceInvolvedDeathsInCanada">link</a> to the github org where I'll be hosting the data.  I'll give an interactive map & a brief discussion the data types used (nominal) ratio (police involved death rate and how they can be used together.  I think this is a good example of how qualitative data and descriptor can be very useful.  But its also super depressing.</p>
