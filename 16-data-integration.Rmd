##  Spatial data errors   
###  Accuracy vs. Precision   
Measurement Errors
Accuracy:
The degree to which a set of measurements correctly matches the real world values.  How close are we to the real value?
If there is a consistent (systematic) offset from that real world value, our measurements are inaccurate. They have a bias.
Precision:
The degree of agreement between multiple measurements of the same real world phenomena. How repeatable is a measurement? 
If you take five measurements of the same feature, how likely are they to be similar?  Lack of precision can be attributed to random errors.

### Vaugeness and Ambiguity
Vaugeness - Victoria ... does it mean Victoria BC vs. Victoria AU

Ambiguity - coastline - is it the high water line? Low water line? mean water level?

###  Quantifying spatial errors    RMSE, Euclid's distance

<p id="box-text">I'll discuss some footprint mapping work I've done. Here is <a href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/4421/2020/bg-17-4421-2020-discussion.html">the article</a>.  I'll an overview of combining raster data (drone imagery & flux footprint) with vector data (landscape classification boundaries) to get the flux contribution of the major vegetation types at Illisarvik.  I can create some illustrative figures..</p>

<p id="box-text">Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and [entered into the bibliography](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html){target="_blank"}. Avoid linking to external resources without a DOI and permanent URL. Contact Paul or try using the Leaflet package in R if you want to add an interactive web map.</p>
