# Chapter Title {#data-integration}

**Data Integration**, This chapter is about ....


**This will be a bit easier to finalize after I see a draft of the book, so I know more broadly what has been covered in the previous chapters.**

16.1  Problems with data integration    
16.1.1  Data types, sources, formats    
16.1.2  Datums, extents, scales   
16.1.3  Data resolutions    
##  Integrating vector and raster data

 - Chris Liang - Is this already written up?  How/where to we intend to include it?

16.2.1  Rasterization   
16.2.2  Vectorization   
 - Could make a cool little visualization showing how to go between the two.  Either static images an animation, or video screen share.

16.2.5  Smoothing   
16.2.6  Simplifying   


##  Spatial data errors   
###  Accuracy vs. Precision   
Measurement Errors
Accuracy:
The degree to which a set of measurements correctly matches the real world values.  How close are we to the real value?
If there is a consistent (systematic) offset from that real world value, our measurements are inaccurate. They have a bias.
Precision:
The degree of agreement between multiple measurements of the same real world phenomena. How repeatable is a measurement? 
If you take five measurements of the same feature, how likely are they to be similar?  Lack of precision can be attributed to random errors.

### Vaugeness and Ambiguity
Vaugeness - Victoria ... does it mean Victoria BC vs. Victoria AU

Ambiguity - coastline - is it the high water line? Low water line? mean water level?

###  Quantifying spatial errors    RMSE, Euclid's distance

### Logical Errors
- Ecological Fallacy, Atomistic Fallacy, MAUP etc.  Its important to include these, whether here or elsewhere?

### Other Errors?
- source data errors, out of date data, data entry & digitization?

<p id="box-text">Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and [entered into the bibliography](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html){target="_blank"}.
