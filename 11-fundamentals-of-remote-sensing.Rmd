# Fundamentals of remote sensing {#chapter-template}

At some point in your life you may have wondered why the sky is blue. You may have noticed that two leaves on the same tree are slightly different shades of green. It would be perfectly natural to wonder these things and simply allow the questions to remain unanswered. After all, they likely carry minimal significance compared to the other queries of your life. What if, however, these questions could not only be answered, but also lead you to profound insights relating to your environment? What if differences in leaf color indicated an early summer drought or the initial stages of a pest outbreak that would wreak havoc on the economy? *Remote sensing* is the overarching term that refers any scientific exploration that seeks to address these, and many other questions.

## What is remote sensing?  TEST!!!!!!!

Simply put, remote sensing is any method of gathering information about an object, or objects, without physical contact. Over the course of human history, a variety of remote sensing techniques have been used. In fact, one could argue that any organism capable of observing light, such as human sight, has a built in optical remote sensing system. Similar arguments could be made for other senses, such as smell or hearing, but we will focus on techniques that capture the properties of light. The first recorded use of optical remote sensing occurred \_\_\_\_ (Plato). Over the next few centuries a variety of photosensitive chemicals were discovered and, in \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ established the technique recognized as photography. The ability to record specific objects within a scene proved enabled the preservation of information in a rapid and accessible medium. Eventually, photography became a prominent means of immortalizing everything from individual humans to exotic landscapes. After all, a picture says a thousand words. In 1851, an enthusiastic Frenchman named Gaspard Tournachon mounted a camera on a hot air balloon and captured images of the earth below him. These images were taken as the camera looked straight down, or nadir, at the City of \_\_\_ and provided a novel view of the city. For the first time it was possible to examine the distribution of buildings, fields, forests and roads across the landscape. With this, airborne remote sensing was born. Remote sensing technologies continued to advance throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with major socio-political conflicts like World War I and II acting as crucibles for innovation. The advancement of remote sensing has continued into the 21st century and is unlikely to slow down in the future. This is due to the relevance of three key aspects. First and foremost, remote sensing enables the observation of objects in, or from, locations that are otherwise inaccessible for humans. The observation of Mars' surface from an orbiting satellite is a one current example. A second aspect that makes remote sensing so useful is the collection of information over a large area. For example, airborne remote sensing technologies enable the evaluation of landcover over large spatial scales (Figure of Canadian Landcover Map Hermosilla). The ability to evaluate inaccessible objects or large areas over time is a third valuable aspect of remote sensing as almost all aspects of land management are informed by observing historic patterns and processes. This is especially true for projects aiming to restore degraded ecosystems or plan sustainable land use practices. However, before exploring the specific sensor designs or applications that make use of these three key elements it is essential to grasp the theories that provide structure to remote sensing science.

## Types of Energy

### Introduction

Stepping back from optical remote sensing for a moment, there are three general types of energy commonly used to remotely observe objects: sonic, thermal and electromagnetic. Sonic, or sound, energy is commonly used in environments where heat or light are inconsistent or hard to measure. Sonar is as example of a sonic remote sensing technique and is often deployed to observe objects in liquid. Thermal, or heat, energy is used in a variety of cases when changes in temperature indicate an underlying physiological process. An environmental example would be the observation of plant health via leaf temperature. Although both sonic and thermal energies provide useful information across a variety of disciplines, they are not the most common.

Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has proven useful in remote sensing and can be applied in a wide range of scientific areas, including medicine and ecology. EMR can be defined as a dynamic form of energy that (Shefali Aggarwal, 2004) EXPAND

Essentially, photons emitted from a natural source, such as the sun, or a manufactured instrument, like a light bulb, interact with the objects around them. These interactions can be observed and used to evaluate the properties of the object. A fundamental component of electromagnetic energy it's wavelength, defined as the measured space between two consecutive peaks of a wave (image). The wavelength of a photon determines if and how it will interact with the particles that make up an object. The value of the wavelength, or \_\_\_\_\_ to be specific, places a photon along a linear continuum called the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Due to the large range of wavelengths that photons exhibit it is necessary to use specific style of writing to describe their location on the EMS.

### Scientific Notation

Expressing extremely large or small numbers presents a challenge to both efficiency and accessibility that has existed likely since the creation of mathematics. Scientific notation presents a simple solution to this problem through simplifying numeric presentation to a value less than 10 that is raised to a particular power. Put simply, the decimal point of a large or small number is moved to make the smallest, single digit whole number. The number of places and direction that the decimal point moves can then be described by an associated power. Figure \_a and b depict how large and small numbers are presented in scientific notation.

### Photons

The high importance of photons in optical remote sensing promotes the need to deeply understand their properties. A photon is the smallest unit of discrete electromagnetic radiation and is the basic unit of light (Lewis and Wolfers 1926). Photos are both waves and particles that exist only as entities moving at the speed of light. They also have no mass REFERNCES VIDEO OR WEBPAGE?. These features make photons unique, which in turn create an opportunity to evaluate photonic properties and their interactions with other particles.

Remote sensing science is generally interested in two main properties of photons: their energy and their intensity. Combined, these characteristics determine the qualities of photonic radiation and make it possible to examine the interaction between photons and their environment, as well as infer relationships . It is through evaluating the relationships between photons in various states and other particles that remote sensing hypotheses are tested, so it is important to understand the concepts of photonic energy and frequency.

Perhaps the simplest method of describing the energy associated with photons is through the use of an equation. Albert Einstein explained the energy of a photon as the product of its wave frequency (the number of waves that pass a specific point over a certain amount of time and Planck's constant (Equation 1)

$$
E = hf
$$ Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant (h = 4.14 × 10^−15^ eV/s) and f is the wave frequency. Clearly, an increase in frequency results in an increase of energy. This equation may be altered to use alternative properties, such as the speed of light and wavelength (Equation 2).

$$
E = hc/λ
$$ Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light (c = 3x10^8^ m/s) and λ is the wavelength of the radiation. This equation contains more variables, but incorporates wavelength and in doing so utilizes an easy to measure (hc = 1240 eV/nm) and familiar characteristic that links nicely with the EMS scale presented earlier in this chapter . It also demonstrates that an increase in wavelength results in a decrease in energy.

## Physical laws of radiation

### Theoretical blackbodies

As a substance is heated, the atoms within it vibrate at higher energies. These vibrations rapidly change the shape and energies of electron orbitals. As the energy of the electrons changes, photons emitted and absorbed at energies corresponding to the energy of the change. Blackbody radiation is what causes light bulbs to glow, and the heat of an object to be felt from a great distance. The simplification of objects as blackbodies allows indirect temperature calculation of distant objects. Astronomers and kitchen infrared thermometers use this principle every day.
