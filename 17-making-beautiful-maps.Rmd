# Making Beautiful Maps {#making-beautiful-maps}

A map _is not_ the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a _similar structure_ to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.
—Alfred Korzybski, _Science and Sanity_, 1933


**Making beautiful maps**, _or making effective maps_, is comparable to being able to tell a good story. Just like a good story, a beautiful map comprises certain elements that, put together, frame the narrative in a way that makes it easy for others to understand and interpret. In this way, a map is a communication device. It conveys information through a visual representation of the spatial relationships of the features for a specific area. To better understand maps as particular form of visual communication, it may be helpful to think about what it is that maps actually do.

Maps represent areas larger than we can see, usually from above, and some depict phenomena that cannot be seen (Manson and Matson 2017), such as growing seasons. They also illustrate spatial relationships, such as this map showing the percentage of the population aged 65 and over by census tract in Moncton, New Brunswick. We can deduce that those aged 65 years and over are concentrated in certain areas of the city, using census tracts as a proxy.

Cartography is the art and science of designing maps and consists of certain principles and rules that help ensure accuracy and clarity. All maps are simplified representations of a place and reflect the particular choices and motivations of the cartographer. Cartography is as much about deciding what to omit from a map as it choosing what to include. Making beautiful maps involves the art, and science, of selecting and modifying data and portraying concepts with clarity and precision. Decisions around colour, font size, graphical hierarchies, classification themes, and legends are all elements of maps that determine how effective, and accurate, they are in conveying information. In this chapter, you will learn about what elements go into making an effective map, the different categories of maps, and the principles of map design.

## Types of Maps

There are many different types of maps. Just try doing a Google search, and you will come across descriptions of thematic, cadastral, topographic, and physiographic maps, to name but a few. There is no standard agreement on how many different categories of maps exist. Although some differentiate among as many as five  types of maps based on the functions they serve (ICSM 2021), all maps can also be categorized into just two types, reference and thematic. Reference maps represent the human-made or natural features of the landscape and are sometimes thought of as basemaps. They provide information about a particular location, such as in the example below, depicting the longest rivers in the location of Canada and where they overlap with the United States. Topographic maps based on the [National Topographic System (NTS)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/topographic-information/maps/national-topographic-system-maps/9767) are another example of reference maps.

### Thematic Maps

Thematic maps depict the spatial distribution of particular features, which are symbolized according to the quantitative or qualitative values of their attributes. Thematic maps, as the name implies, emphasize a particular theme, using qualitative or quantitative data. Whereas reference maps show the locations of things, such as the locations of mountains, a thematic map might represent the geology of those mountains. 

Qualitative thematic maps illustrate the spatial extent of categorical data (Anderson 2020), such as the 1956 map bedrock geology map below.

) (c) Comtois and Nicholson, [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).](images/03-geology.jpg){.center}

Quantitative thematic maps depict the spatial patterns of numerical data, often expressed as rates or percentages, as in the map below showing the difference in population change between two periods, where the difference is expressed as a percentage.

) (c) [Statistics Canada](https://www-statcan-gc-ca.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/eng/about/about?MM=as), [Open Government License - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).](images/04-population.jpg){.center}

### Choropleth Maps

There are many different types of thematic types. A commonly used thematic map is a choropleth map, which applies different colours or shading to the entire extent of a predefined aereal unit (Weiss et al. 2008). Data used in choropleth maps must be standardized and represented as rates or ratios rather than raw counts or numbers.

One of the reasons choropleth maps are so widely used is because much of the data with which we're concerned, such as demographic data, is tied to aereal units like Census tracts or counties. With the advent of browser-based web mapping applications such as ArcGIS Online, choropleth maps can easily be created in just a few steps. The map below was created in Esri's ArcGIS Online and represents the COVID-19 case fatality ratio for Canada's health regions.

![A choropleth map representing the 
case fatality ratio of COVID-19 for health 
regions in Canada.] (c) Maya Daurio (images/05-choropleth.jpg){.center}

This map is also a good example of the potential problems with choropleth maps, which has to do something called the [Modifiable areal unit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem), or MAUP. This results when data such as population, the measurement of population per unit area, is aggregated into an aereal unit, where the shape and scale of the unit affects the resulting rates, or values, of the data. In this map example, the areal unit is a health region, which vary considerably by size and population density across Canada. Canada's population is also largely concentrated along the U.S.-Canada border, which might explain why the case fatality ratio is higher in areas with more concentrated populations. This map fails to convey that kind of nuance.
