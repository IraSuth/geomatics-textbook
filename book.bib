This paper contains evidence in support of a new 'configurational' paradigm in which a primary property of the form of the urban grid is to privilege certain spaces over others for through movement. In this way it is suggested that the configuration of the urban grid itself is the main generator of patterns of movement. Retail land uses are then located to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the passing trade and may well act as multipliers on the basic pattern of 'natural movement' generated by the grid configuration. The configurational correlates of movement patterns are found to be measures of global properties of the grid with the 'space syntax' measure of 'integration' consistently found to be the most important. This has clear implications for urban design suggesting that if we wish to design for well used urban space, then it is not the local properties of a space that are important in the main but its configurational relations to the larger urban system.},

So, space syntax measures are chosen as the principal theoretical postulates for analysis, because of its quantitative and scientific approach. In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse the spatial structure of the street network in an Indian city \textendash{} Mysore \textendash{} by a comprehensive application of space syntax techniques. The study has been conducted by breaking down the structure into components and by analysing the use of different measures, like integration and choice, using Depthmap software (Turner, 2012).

We can then see clearly how a very few core nodes dominate this network, there are approximately 200 countries in the world but these 19 largest jurisdictions in terms of capital together are responsible for over 90\% of the assets. This type of  centralized structure to a network is surprisingly reverent in our world and we could cite many other examples of it, such as social networks where a very few people may have millions of people connected to them and the vast majority very few. These highly centralized networks are more formally called scale free or power law networks, that describe a power or exponential relationship between the degree of connectivity a node has and the frequency of its occurrence. These power law networks are really define by the mathematics that is behind them so lets just take a quick look at that it. In these networks, The number of nodes with degree x is proportional to 1 over x squared So, The number of nodes with degree 2 is one fourth of all the nodes The number of nodes with degree 3 is one ninth of the nodes The number of nodes with degree 10 is proportional to one hundredth If we have a network with a thousand nodes of degree one then we would have 250 nodes with degree two, and proximally 31 with degree ten. If we notice then when we go from degree one to degree two we had a very big drop, but then going from degree two to teen the drop is a lot more gradual and this decline continues to get more gradual giving the graph what is called a long tail. The point to take away from this is that this long tail means there can be nodes with a very high degree but there will also be very many with a very low degree of connectivity giving us our centralized network.  This type of power law graph was first discover within the degree distribution of websites on the internet with some websites like Google and Yahoo having very many links into them but there also being very many sites out on the web that have a very few links into them.  Since then it has been discovered in many types of very different networks such as in metabolic networks where the essential molecules of ATP and ADP that provide the energy to fuel cells play a central role interacting with a very many different molecules, where as most of the molecule interaction very few others, thus making these two molecule hubs in the metabolic networks fueling the cells in our bodies.

Transcription: When we hear the word network all sorts of things spring to mind like social networks and the Internet in particular, but the power of network theory is really in its high degree of abstraction, so the first thing for us to do is to try and start back at the beginning by forgetting what we think we know about networks and embrace the abstract language of networks what is called graph theory. In the formal language of mathematics a network is called a graph and graph theory is the area of mathematics that studies these objects called graphs. The first theory of graphs goes back to 1736, the first textbook came about in 1958 but most of the work within this field is less than a few decades old. In its essence a graph is really very simple, it consist of just two parts what are called vertices and edges. Firstly Vertices; a vertex or node is a thing, that is to say it is an entity and we can ascribe some value to it, so a person is an example of a node as is a car, planet, farm, city or molecule. All of these things have static properties that can be quantifies, such as the color of our car, the size of our farm, or the weight of our molecule. Within network science vertices are more often called nodes so we will be typically using this term during the course. Edges can be define as a relation of some sort between two or more nodes, this connection may be tangible as in the cables between computers on a network or the roads between cities within a national transportation system or these edges may by be intangible, such as social relations of friendship. Edges may be also called links, ties or relations and we will be often using this latter term during the course. The nodes belonging to an edge are called the ends, endpoints, or end vertices of the edge. Within graph theory networks are called graphs and a graph is define as a set of edges and a set vertices. A simple graph does not contain loops or multiple edges, but a multigraph is a graph with multiple edges between nodes. So where as a simple graph of a transpiration system would just tell us if there is a connection between two cities, a multigraph would show all the different connections between the two cities. Graphs can be directed or undirected. With an undirected graph edges have no orientation, for example a diplomatic relation between two nations may be mutual and thus have no direction to the edge between the nodes. These undirected graphs have unordered pairs of nodes, that means we can just switch them round, if Jane and Paul are married, we can say Jane is married to Paul or we can say Paul is married to Jane it makes no difference and thus it is an unordered pair.

Transcription excerpt: How something spreads across a network is a key question we will be interested in asking when analyzing many different networks, the classical example of this being the diffusion of a disease through some population, but we might be talking about how the loss of one species in an ecosystem has an effect on others, the spread of financial contagion from one institution to another, or the spread of some information within a group of people. More formally we call this spreading on a network propagation or diffusion, how diffusion happens and how long it takes is defined by a number of different parameters. We will just list the primary factors involved here before looking into them individually. Firstly we have some infectiousness metric, where we are talking about how infectious is the phenomena that is spreading on the network.  A corollary to this is asking how resistant are the nodes to this contagion giving us a resistance parameter.  Next we need to consider the topology to the network, obviously this diffusion is taking place along the connections within the network, meaning different structures to the connections and different degree distribution will be another defining factor when considering diffusion. Lastly we need to consider if this diffusion is taking place strategically or at random and this ties back to topology because as we have already discussed some network topologies are more susceptible to strategic influence then others. So Firstly to discuss infectiousness: By infectiousness we mean something that is likely to spread or influence others in a rapid manner, irrespective of the type of network it is spreading on. If you hear about some important piece of news, you feel driven to tell others and that is infectiousness, it is like an out word force that is pushing the phenomena across local connections and out over the network. We may be able to quantify this in terms of money or how contagious a disease is or a number of other metrics but we also need to ask, how many nodes a given node can infect in any given time interval? A mosquito can only bit one other creature at a time but a person can broadcast a message to possibly millions of other people at any given instance, thus enabling a much more rapid contagion rate. Inversely we need to think about how resistant the nodes in the network are to the spreading of this phenomena.  Imagine trying to promote gay mirage in some conservator rural community, no matter how infectious your campaign is it is unlikely to take off and this is due not to your failures but to the resistant of the other nodes in the network to this phenomena.  We could also add time to our model here, capturing how nodes may be affected for only a brief period of time before recovery, As would be the case with the spread of many diseases or some trend in fashion.

As network theory is a very new subject much of it is still focused on trying to explore the basics of static graphs, as the study of their dynamics results in the additional of a whole new sets of parameters to our models and takes us into a new level of complexity, much of which remains unexplored, and is the subject of active research. Transcription excerpt: So lets start by talking about growing a random network to see what it looks like, when we say growing a network we might mean adding more nodes to it, but also, more interestingly adding links to it, that increases the overall connectivity. In our random model links were just placed between nodes at random with some given probability, growing the network here just meant increasing this probability so as to have more links develop over time. One interesting thing we find when we do this is that there are thresholds and phase transitions during the network's development, by thresholds we simply mean that, by gradually increasing our link probability parameter, some property to the network suddenly appearing when we pass a critical value.  So for example our first threshold is when the average degree goes above 1 over the total number of nodes in the network, as at this threshold we start to get our first connection. At degree one that is when every node has on average one connection the network stars to appear connected, we see one giant component  emerging within the network, that is one dominant cluster and we start to have cycles, which means there are feedback loops in the network. Another threshold occurs when nodes have an average degree of log(n) at this point everything starts to be connected meaning there is typically a path to all other nodes in the network. So this is what we see in random network but as we know most real world networks are not random as they are subject to some resource constraints and they have preferential attachment giving them clusters that we do not see in these random graphs. One way of thinking about how real world networks form is through the lens of percolation theory, percolation theory looks at how something filters all percolates through something else like a liquid filtering through some mash structure in a material or we might think about some water running down the side of the hill, as it does the water will find the path of least resistance creating channels and furrows in the side of the hill. This network formation is then the product of the resource constraints that its environment placed upon it, but the constraints are unevenly distributed and the networks topology is then reflecting this as it follows the paths of least resistance as it avoids toughest material. In order to demonstrate the general relevance of this we will take some other examples, if say we put on a cheap flights from one city to another then people will start using that transportation link because of financial constraints. Or because of phenomena of Homophily within social networks we will get the same peculation dynamic where it will be easier for people to make links with people who are similar to themselves than with others, again creating a particular structure based on the social constraints within the system.

As the name implies network theory is all about the study of networks, we are trying to create models so as to analyze them, in order to be able to do this the first thing we need is some kind of formal language and this formal language is called graph theory. We will be going into the details of graph theory in the next lecture but it is a relatively new area of mathematics that gives us some kind of standardized language with which to talk about and quantify the structure and properties of networks. So once we have this basic vocabulary, say you give me a network to analyze the question then turns to what are the features and properties of this network that we should be really interested. The first set of questions we might like to ask relate to individual elements within the network. We want to know what are the nodes within the network what are the connections between them and what properties are we really interested in, for example in a computer network we might not be interested in who owns the different computers and connections but just interested in the speed of the computers and the bandwidth of the connections, so we need to define what it is about our network we are interested in because as with all models we will be focusing on some information and excluding other. There is lots of other information we want to know about these individual elements and the connections, such as asking whether they are weighted or not, meaning can we ascribe a value to them, we can talk about a computer network's bandwidth in megabits per second, but it might not be so easy to do the same with a social network where the relations are of friendship or kinship. We can also ask if these relations go both ways or are just unidirectional. Other questions we will be asking here is how connected is any individual node or how central is it within the overall network. The next major set of questions we will be asking about our network will relate to its overall structure, networks are defined by both what happens on the local level, that is how central or connected you are, but also what happens on the global level, because the dynamics of the network on the global level feeds back to effect the elements on the local level. Here some of the key questions we will be asking about the overall structure to the network is firstly how connected is it? Are there connections between all the parts or are some parts disconnect and separate from others? How dense is this set of connections? If we compare a group of unassociated people waiting at a bus stop with a close knit group of friends we will see the density of the network will vary greatly. What are the patters of clustering within the system? Do we see many small groups or just a few large groups? These are the types of features that will define the overall makeup of the network structure. One key question we are interested in answering here is if we change some parameter to one of                   Show less                   Show more},

  abstract = {In mathematics and computational geometry,  a Delaunay triangulation (also known as a Delone triangulation) for a given set P of discrete points in a general position is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles. The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.For a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation (the notion of triangulation is degenerate for this case).  For four or more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfies the "Delaunay condition", i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles of all triangles have empty interiors. By considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions.  Generalizations are possible to metrics other than Euclidean distance. However, in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to map large spatial flow data due to the problem of occlusion and cluttered display, where hundreds of thousands of flows overlap and intersect each other. Existing flow mapping approaches often aggregate flows using predetermined high-level geographic units (e.g. states) or bundling partial flow lines that are close in space, both of which cause a significant loss or distortion of information and may miss major patterns. In this research, we developed a flow clustering method that extracts clusters of similar flows to avoid the cluttering problem, reveal abstracted flow patterns, and meanwhile preserves data resolution as much as possible. Specifically, our method extends the traditional hierarchical clustering method to aggregate and map large flow data. The new method considers both origins and destinations in determining the similarity of two flows, which ensures that a flow cluster represents flows from similar origins to similar destinations and thus minimizes information loss during aggregation. With the spatial index and search algorithm, the new method is scalable to large flow data sets. As a hierarchical method, it generalizes flows to different hierarchical levels and has the potential to support multi-resolution flow mapping. Different distance definitions can be incorporated to adapt to uneven spatial distribution of flows and detect flow clusters of different densities. To assess the quality and fidelity of flow clusters and flow maps, we carry out a case study to analyze a data set of 243,850 taxi trips within an urban area.},

  abstract = {Background: Children's physical inactivity and obesity are growing public health problems in the U.S., especially among low-income, minority populations. Walking to school may help address these problems. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined disparities in the environmental support for walking around 73 public elementary schools in Austin TX. GIS was used to measure the neighborhood-level walkability and safety. Field audits were conducted to assess the street-level walkability. Analyses of variance and regressions were performed to analyze economic and ethnic disparities. Results: For the top-quartile schools with higher poverty or Hispanic student percentages, the surroundings showed higher neighborhood-level walkability with shorter distances to school and more sidewalks compared with the bottom quartile. These areas, however, also had higher crash and crime rates and lower street-level walkability captured by visual quality, physical amenities, maintenance, and perceived safety. In predictions of environmental conditions using poverty and Hispanic student percentages, poverty was associated with many adverse conditions on the street level and with only two favorable situations, shorter distances to school and lower traffic volumes, on the neighborhood level. The Hispanic student percentage did not correlate with most street-level variables, but predicted both increased dangers from traffic and crime and higher neighborhood-level walkability with more sidewalks, greater density, and mixed land uses. Conclusions: Economic and ethnic disparities exist in the environmental support for walking, suggesting},

  abstract = {Research on urban walkability does not always make a clear distinction between design features supporting walkability and those leading to a sense of urban liveliness. Walkability, for this article's purposes, entails the opportunity for continuous movement across some distance and therefore engages both the local and global street networks. Urban liveliness, by contrast, may exist in isolated pockets that provide limited support for physical activity. This case study of a large, urban smart growth development in Atlanta, Georgia, provides an example of a new development with characteristics that suggest a high degree of walkability. However, observational data show pedestrians are clumped on relatively few street segments rather than distributed throughout the site, indicating it is unlikely that the site is hosting much walking between the development and its surrounds. This descriptive case study is intended to contribute to more explicit theory of how environmental design contributes to walking.},

MM sampling involves combining well-established qualitative and quantitative techniques in creative ways to answer research questions posed by MM research designs. Several issues germane to MM sampling are presented including the differences between probability and purposive sampling and the probability-mixed-purposive sampling continuum. Four MM sampling prototypes are introduced: basic MM sampling strategies, sequential MM sampling, concurrent MM sampling, and multilevel MM sampling. Examples of each of these techniques are given as illustrations of how researchers actually generate MM samples. Finally, eight guidelines for MM sampling are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

@article{Howell2020,
abstract = {Background: Most studies among Hispanics have focused on individual risk factors of obesity, with less attention on interpersonal, community and environmental determinants. Conducting community based surveys to study these determinants must ensure representativeness of disparate populations. We describe the use of a novel Geographic Information System (GIS)-based population based sampling to minimize selection bias in a rural community based study. Methods: We conducted a community based survey to collect and examine social determinants of health and their association with obesity prevalence among a sample of Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites living in a rural community in the Southeastern United States. To ensure a balanced sample of both ethnic groups, we designed an area stratified random sampling procedure involving three stages: (1) division of the sampling area into non-overlapping strata based on Hispanic household proportion using GIS software; (2) random selection of the designated number of Census blocks from each stratum; and (3) random selection of the designated number of housing units (i.e., survey participants) from each Census block. Results: The proposed sample included 109 Hispanic and 107 non-Hispanic participants to be recruited from 44 Census blocks. The final sample included 106 Hispanic and 111 non-Hispanic participants. The proportion of Hispanic surveys completed per strata matched our proposed distribution: 7% for strata 1, 30% for strata 2, 58% for strata 3 and 83% for strata 4. Conclusion: Utilizing a standardized area based randomized sampling approach allowed us to successfully recruit an ethnically balanced sample while conducting door to door surveys in a rural, community based study. The integration of area based randomized sampling using tools such as GIS in future community-based research should be considered, particularly when trying to reach disparate populations.},

abstract = {The disjunctive kriging (DK) method described in detail in the previous paper of this series is illustrated by two examples. The first example is for the electrical conductivity (EC) which is approximately lognormally distributed. In the second example the natural logarithm of the EC is used to produce an approximately normally distributed data set. The data set was chosen since the Hermite coefficients for a normal and lognormal distribution could be determined analytically as well as to facilitate a comparison between ordinary and disjunctive kriging. The capability of DK to be a nonlinear estimator and an estimator of the conditional probability is explored. The results indicate that DK is a better estimator than linear estimators (i.e., ordinary kriging) in the sense of reduced variance of errors and average kriging variance even when the data are approximately normally or lognormally distributed. Also, using DK one can obtain an estimate of the conditional probability. Copyright 1986 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Two non-parametric kriging methods such as indicator kriging and probability kriging were compared and used to estimate the probability of concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Mn higher than a threshold value in groundwater. In indicator kriging, experimental semivariogram values were fitted well in spherical model for Fe and Mn. Exponential model was found to be best for all the metals in probability kriging and for Cu in indicator kriging. The probability maps of all the metals exhibited an increasing risk of pollution over the entire study area. Probability kriging estimator incorporates the information about order relations which the indicator kriging does not, has improved the accuracy of estimating the probability of metal concentrations in groundwater being higher than a threshold value. Evaluation of these two spatial interpolation methods through mean error (ME), mean square error (MSE), kriged reduced mean error (KRME), and kriged reduced mean square error (KRMSE) showed 3.52% better performance of probability kriging over indicator kriging. The combined result of these two kriging method indicated that on an average 26.34%, 65.36%, and 99.55% area for Cu, Fe, and Mn, respectively, are coming under the risk zone with probability of exceedance from a cutoff value is 0.6 or more. The groundwater quality map pictorially represents groundwater zones as "desirable" or "undesirable" for drinking. Thus the geostatistical approach is very much helpful for the planners and decision makers to devise policy guidelines for efficient management of the groundwater resources so as to enhance groundwater recharge and minimize the pollution level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A spherical model is employed as the experimental variogram to aid the spatial interpolation and cross-validation. The kriged data are subjected to leave-one-out cross-validation. The data used are in both vector and raster format. Statistical measures of correctness (mean prediction error, root-mean-square error, standardized root-mean-square error, average standard error) from the cross-validation are used to compare the kriging algorithms.

abstract = {This book is a completely new version of the highly successful Principles of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment which was first published in 1986. GIS are not just used for electronic map-making but today are major tools for the management of our physical and social environment. GIS are used to assist political decisions and play a part in market research, in the management of utility services, in automated navigation systems and in many other fields. This book presents a strong theoretical basis for GIS, which is often lacking in other texts. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous paradigms, exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels, or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature or rainfall. Methods for modelling both kinds of phenomena and storing them in spatial databases are described in detail, including the use of geostatistics for interpolating from points to continuous fields. Examples of how spatial data and an analysis of their spatial interactions are used to solve a wide range of practical problems ranging from site-location analysis through land degradation, the optimizing of timber extraction from forests and the redistribution of Chernobyl radioactivity by floods are explained clearly and in detail. Much attention is paid to the problems of data quality and how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an investigation of current developments in providing spatial data for the whole world over the Internet. As such the new volume provides a comprehensive and concise introduction to the theory and practice of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Targeted at undergraduates, graduates, and professionals in disciplines such as physical and human geography, hydrology, geology, environmental science, cartography, epidemiology, radioecology, agriculture, spatial planning, land tenure, and land evaluation the book explains why spatial data and the information systems based on them are important in the modern world.},

abstract = {Before the development of the germ theory â relating microorganisms with disease transmission (1880) â people believed that diseases were transmitted by odours. Water and sewage disinfection emerged as a method for elimination of odours. There are many disinfecting agents, but chlorine is the main product used to disinfect water. Organic compounds present in water that is chlorinated can result in the formation of trihalomethanes. The latter are basically one atom of carbon, one of hydrogen, and three of a halogen (chlorine, bromine, or iodine). These are considered carcinogenic compounds and their presence in drinking water should therefore be avoided. Epidemiological research has shown an association between trihalomethane concentration and cancer morbidity and mortality for some types of carcinoma. Nevertheless, there may be more risk than benefit involved in replacing chlorine with other disinfecting agents, since the incidence of water-borne diseases only dropped after water chlorination became a routine procedure.

abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (â¼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30Â°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

This method is very important to get information on the dispersal patterns characteristic of a region and linkages between locations. In this study, it applied on the incidence of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in 17 sub districts in Sleman, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province. The link among location indicated by a spatial weight matrix. It describe the structure of neighbouring and reflects the spatial influence. According to the spatial data, type of weighting matrix can be divided into two types: point type (distance) and the neighbourhood area (contiguity). Selection weighting function is one determinant of the results of the spatial analysis. This study use queen contiguity based on first order neighbour weights, queen contiguity based on second order neighbour weights, and inverse distance weights. Queen contiguity first order and inverse distance weights shows that there is the significance spatial autocorrelation in DHF, but not by queen contiguity second order. Queen contiguity first and second order compute 68 and 86 neighbour list.},

abstract = {Geostatistics brings to ecology novel tools for the interpretation of spatial patterns of organisms, of the numerous environmental components with which they interact, and of the joint spatial dependence between organisms and their environment. The purpose of this paper is to use data from the ecological literature as well as from original research to provide a comprehensive and easily understood analysis of geostatistics' manner of modeling and methods. The traditional geostatistical tool, the variogram, a tool that is beginning to be used in ecology, is shown to provide an incomplete and misleading summary of spatial pattern when local means and variances change. Use of the non-ergodic covariance and correlogram provides a more effective description of lag-to-lag spatial dependence because the changing local means and variances are accounted for. Indicator transformations capture the spatial patterns of nominal ecological variables like gene frequencies and the presence/absence of an organism and of subgroups of a population like large or small individuals. Robust variogram measures are shown to be useful in data sets that contain many data outliers. Appropriate removal of outliers reveals latent spatial dependence and patterns. Cross-variograms, cross-covariances, and cross-correlograms define the joint spatial dependence between co-occurring organisms. The results of all of these analyses bring new insights into the spatial relations of organisms in their environment.},

abstract = {In this study, different interpolation techniques are presented, assessed, and compared for the estimation of soil iron (Fe) contents in locations where observations were not available. Initially, 400 soil samples from the Kozani area, which is near Polifitou Lake in northern Greece, were randomly collected from 2013 to 2015 and were analysed in the laboratory to determine the soil Fe concentrations and pH. The soil Fe concentrations were examined for spatial autocorrelation, and semivariograms were used to determine whether pH and Fe exhibited spatial cross correlation. Three interpolation methods, including Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, and Co-Kriging, were applied, and their results were compared with the use of two different cross-validation methods. In the current study, there was evidence of spatial cross correlation of soil Fe and pH for each year, which was subsequently used to improve the interpolation results in locations where there were no measurements. In nearly all cases, Co-Kriging, which takes advantage of the covariance between the two regionalized variables (Fe and pH), outperformed the other interpolation techniques each year.},

@article{Pebesma2005,
abstract = {In the Dutch sector of the North Sea, sea bird densities are recorded bi-monthly by using airborne strip-transect monitoring. From these data we try to estimate: (i) high-resolution spatial patterns of sea bird densities; (ii) low-resolution spatial-average bird densities for large areas; and (iii) temporal changes in (i) and (ii), using data on Fulmaris glacialis as an example. For spatial estimation, we combined Poisson regression for modelling the trend as a function of water depth and distance to coast with kriging interpolation of the residual variability, assuming spatial (co)variances to be proportional to the trend value. Spatial averages were estimated by block kriging. For estimating temporal differences we used residual cokriging for two consecutive years, and show how this can be extended to analyse trends over multiple years. Approximate standard errors are obtained for all estimates. A comparison with a residual simple kriging approach reveals that ignoring temporal cross-correlations leads to a severe loss of statistical accuracy when assessing the significance of temporal changes.This article shows results for Fulmaris glacialis monitored during August/September in 1998 and 1999.

@article{Meng2009,
abstract = {Tree height-diameter relationships are usually studied using linear or nonlinear models, but exogenous variables, especially spatially autocorrelated and dependent variables of tree diameter or height, are not often considered in height-diameter modeling. Three types of spatial regression models - spatial lag model, spatial error model, and spatial Durbin process model - are explored in this study. The height-diameter relationships are modeled using the spatial regression models to investigate the effects of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation and the roles of the exogenous variables generated by neighboring trees. Case study 1 shows that the spatial lag model should be used to analyze height-diameter relationships, in which heights of neighboring trees, which are exogenous variables, and the endogenous variable DBH significantly affect height growth. Case study 2 shows that the spatial error model performs better than other models, and that height growth is not only affected by its endogenous variable diameter but also by unobserved variables that vary spatially and result in residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial regression models are an approach to height-diameter modeling that provide insight into how the endogenous variable diameter, the exogenous variables height and (or) diameter of neighboring trees, and locally varied but unobserved environmental or ecological variables contribute to height growth.},

abstract = {Spatial weights matrices are necessary elements in most regression models where a representation of spatial structure is needed. We construct a spatial weights matrix,W, based on the principle that spatial structure should be considered in a two-part framework, those units that evoke a distance effect, and those that do not. Our two-variable local statistics model (LSM) is based on the G∗ i local statistic. The local statistic concept depends on the designation of a critical distance, dc, defined as the distance beyond which no discernible increase in clustering of high or low values exists. In a series of simulation experiments LSMis compared to well-known spatial weights matrix specifications-two different contiguity configurations, three different inverse distance formulations, and three semi-variance models. The simulation experiments are carried out on a random spatial pattern and two types of spatial clustering patterns. The LSM performed best according to the Akaike Information Criterion, a spatial autoregressive coefficient evaluation, and Moran's I tests on residuals. The flexibility inherent in the LSM allows for its favorable performance when compared to the rigidity of the global models.},

@article{Jacquez1999,
abstract = {Spatial statistics quantify spatial pattern and identify local and global departures from null spatial models. As part of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis they play a critical role in the evaluation of spatial pattern, and in the formulation of hypotheses to explain spatial pattern. While all spatial data have imprecise locations, the magnitude of this imprecision can vary dramatically from one measuring instrument to another and from one study to another. When does location uncertainty impede our ability to quantify spatial pattern? This paper describes credibility-based spatial randomization tests that propagate location uncertainty through proximity metrics and into spatial statistics. Credibility is a flexible new approach to spatial randomization tests, but is not a panacea. It applies to spatial statistics that incorporate measures of geographic proximity (e.g. spatial adjacency, weight, nearest neighbor relationship, distance etc.). It uses Monte Carlo sampling to generate the null distribution, and not distribution theory, as classical statistics do. It is a technique for testing hypotheses regarding spatial pattern, and is best described as a method for Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis. It is meant to complement, not replace, traditional spatial statistics that use P-values and alpha levels. In conjunction with these techniques it forms a quantitative basis for evaluating the likely impact of location uncertainty on one's ability to make statistical decisions with spatial data. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
