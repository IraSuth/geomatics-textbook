You may have noticed that two leaves on the same tree are slightly different shades of green. It would be perfectly natural to wonder these things and simply allow the questions to remain unanswered. After all, they likely carry minimal significance compared to the other queries of your life. What if, however, these questions could not only be answered, but also lead you to profound insights relating to your environment? What if differences in leaf color indicated an early summer drought or the initial stages of a pest outbreak that would wreak havoc on the economy? Remote sensing is the overarching term that refers any scientific exploration that seeks to address these, and many other questions.

Simply put, remote sensing is any method of gathering information about an object, or objects, without physical contact. Over the course of human history, a variety of remote sensing techniques have been used. In fact, one could argue that any organism capable of observing electromagnetic radiation has a built in optical remote sensing system, such as human vision. Similar arguments could be made for other senses, such as smell or hearing, but this chapter will focus strictly on techniques that capture and record electromagnetic radiation. The first recorded use of optical remote sensing occurred ____ (Plato). Over the next few centuries a variety of photosensitive chemicals were discovered and, in ____, ______ established the technique recognized as photography. The ability to record specific objects within a scene proved enabled the preservation of information in a rapid and accessible medium. Eventually, photography became a prominent means of immortalizing everything from individual humans to exotic landscapes. After all, a picture says a thousand words. In 1851, an enthusiastic Frenchman named Gaspard Tournachon mounted a camera on a hot air balloon and captured images of the earth below him. These images were taken as the camera looked straight down, or nadir, at the City of ___ and provided a novel view of the city. For the first time it was possible to examine the distribution of buildings, fields, forests and roads across the landscape. With this, airborne remote sensing was born. Remote sensing technologies continued to advance throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with major socio-political conflicts like World War I and II acting as crucibles for innovation. The advancement of remote sensing has continued into the 21st century and is unlikely to slow down in the future. This is due to the relevance of three key aspects. First and foremost, remote sensing enables the observation of objects in, or from, locations that are otherwise inaccessible for humans. The observation of Mars surface from an orbiting satellite is a one current example. A second aspect that makes remote sensing so useful is the collection of information over a large area. For example, airborne remote sensing technologies enable observations of land cover across Canada (Figure 1). The ability to evaluate inaccessible objects or large areas over time is a third valuable aspect of remote sensing and is particularly relevant for land management, as predictions can be informed through the observation of historic patterns and processes. This is especially true for projects aiming to restore degraded ecosystems or plan sustainable land use practices. Before exploring the designs of specific sensor or their applications, however, it is essential to grasp some key components that underpin remote sensing science. 3.2 Types of Energy 3.2.1 Introduction Stepping back from remote sensing for a moment, there are three general types of energy commonly used to remotely observe objects: sonic, thermal and electromagnetic. Sonic, or sound, energy is commonly used in environments where heat or light are inconsistent or hard to measure. Sonar is as example of a sonic remote sensing technique and is often deployed to observe objects in liquid. Thermal, or heat, energy is used in a variety of cases when changes in temperature indicate an underlying physiological process. An environmental example would be the observation of plant health via leaf temperature. Although both sonic and thermal energies provide useful information across a variety of disciplines, they are not the most common. Electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which is what the human sense of sight observes, is a popular energy source in remote sensing science. At its most basic, this method of observation is based on the measurement of photons. Research using EMR is fundamentally interested in examining the interactions of EMR, or photons, and other particles. Before diving into the applications of EMR remote sensing (photography, spectroscopy, etc.) it is important to understand some basic theory regarding the measurement of photons. Essentially, photons are the smallest physical property in the electromagnetic field. Photons can be emitted from a natural source, such as the sun, or a manufactured instrument, like a light bulb, and interact with the objects around them. These interactions can be observed and used to evaluate the properties of the object. A fundamental component of EMR is its wavelength, defined as the measured space between two consecutive peaks of a wave (IMAGE). The wavelength of a photon determines if and how it will interact with the particles around it, as well as defines the amount of energy it has. Measuring the differences in photonic energy before and after interacting with another particle is the core of any remote sensing utilizing EMR. Perhaps the simplest path to understanding how the properties of photons (i.e. energy, wavelength) are used for remote sensing purposes is through the use of an equation. Albert Einstein explained the energy of a photon as the product of its wave frequency (the number of waves that pass a specific point over a certain amount of time) and Plancks constant (Equation 1). \\[ E = hf \\]Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Plancks constant (h = 4.14 Ã— 1015 eV/s) and f is the wave frequency. Clearly, an increase in frequency results in an increase of energy. This equation may be altered to include other properties, such as the speed of light and wavelength (Equation 2). \\[ E = hc/ \\]Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Plancks constant, c is the speed of light (c = 3x108 m/s) and  is the wavelength of the radiation. This equation contains more variables, but incorporates wavelength and in doing so utilizes an easy to measure (hc always equals 1240 eV/nm) and familiar characteristic. Due to the large range of wavelengths that photons can exhibit it is necessary to use a specific style of writing to describe them, called scientific notation. 3.2.2 Scientific Notation Expressing extremely large or small numbers presents a challenge to both efficiency and accessibility that has existed likely since the creation of mathematics. Scientific notation presents a simple solution to this problem through simplifying numeric presentation to a value less than 10 that is raised to a particular power. Put simply, the decimal point of a large or small number is moved to make the smallest, single digit whole number. The number of places and direction that the decimal point moves is described by an associated power of 10. Equations 1 and 2 depict how large and small numbers are presented in scientific notation, respectively. Equation 1 \\[ 1,000,000 = 1.0 X 10^{6} \\] Equation 2 \\[ 0.000001 = 1.0 X 10 ^{-6} \\] 3.2.3 Electromagnetic Spectrum Now that you have an understanding of how the properties of photons can be measured and how to write them, we can begin to explore the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The EMS is the continuum along within photons are classified based on their wavelength. (Figure 2) 3.2.4 Photons in Remote Sensing The high importance of photons in optical remote sensing promotes the need to deeply understand their properties. A photon is the smallest unit of discrete electromagnetic radiation (Lewis and Wolfers 1926). Photons are both waves and particles that exist only as entities moving at the speed of light (3.0 x 108 m/s). They also have no mass. REFERNCES VIDEO OR WEBPAGE?. These unique features are what present the opportunity to evaluate photonic properties and their interactions with other particles. Remote sensing science is generally interested in two main properties of photons: energy and intensity. Combined, these characteristics determine the qualities of photonic radiation and make it possible to examine the interaction between photons and their environment, as well as infer relationships. It is through evaluating the relationships between photons in various states and other particles that remote sensing hypotheses are tested, so it is important to understand the concepts of photonic energy and frequency. 3.2.5 Radiation Types Since it is possible for photon energy to vary widely, it can be useful to group photons based on their wavelength. Generally, there are seven accepted categories: Radio Microwave Infrared Visible Ultraviolet X rays Gamma rays: represent the shortest Your turn!
