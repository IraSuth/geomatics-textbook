[["data-integration.html", "Chapter 3 Chapter Title 3.1 Spatial data errors", " Chapter 3 Chapter Title Data Integration, This chapter is about . This will be a bit easier to finalize after I see a draft of the book, so I know more broadly what has been covered in the previous chapters. Learning Objectives Objective one Objective two Objective three Key Terms Ipsum lorem, Phasellus, sollicitudin, finibus 16.1 Problems with data integration 16.1.1 Data types, sources, formats 16.1.2 Datums, extents, scales 16.1.3 Data resolutions ## Integrating vector and raster data Chris Liang - Is this already written up? How/where to we intend to include it? 16.2.1 Rasterization 16.2.2 Vectorization - Could make a cool little visualization showing how to go between the two. Either static images an animation, or video screen share. 16.2.5 Smoothing 16.2.6 Simplifying 3.1 Spatial data errors 3.1.1 Accuracy vs. Precision Measurement Errors Accuracy: The degree to which a set of measurements correctly matches the real world values. How close are we to the real value? If there is a consistent (systematic) offset from that real world value, our measurements are inaccurate. They have a bias. Precision: The degree of agreement between multiple measurements of the same real world phenomena. How repeatable is a measurement? If you take five measurements of the same feature, how likely are they to be similar? Lack of precision can be attributed to random errors. Source Source 3.1.2 Vaugeness and Ambiguity Vaugeness - Victoria  does it mean Victoria BC vs. Victoria AU Ambiguity - coastline - is it the high water line? Low water line? mean water level? 3.1.3 Quantifying spatial errors RMSE, Euclids distance 3.1.4 Logical Errors Ecological Fallacy, Atomistic Fallacy, MAUP etc. Its important to include these, whether here or elsewhere? 3.1.5 Other Errors? source data errors, out of date data, data entry &amp; digitization? :::: Case Study Large Scale Footprint mapping, temporal upsaclling Your browser does not support iframes Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and entered into the bibliography. Avoid linking to external resources without a DOI and permanent URL. Contact Paul or try using the Leaflet package in R if you want to add an interactive web map. :::: Case Study Small Scale Case Study: UBC Trees in a Changing Climate The file structure for this case study doesnt match the structure of the template, so Ive left it out for now, until I can get a bit more guidance on it.
