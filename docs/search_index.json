[["data-integration.html", "Chapter 3 Chapter Title 3.1 Integrating vector and raster data 3.2 Spatial data errors", " Chapter 3 Chapter Title Data Integration, This chapter is about . This will be a bit easier to finalize after I see a draft of the book, so I know more broadly what has been covered in the previous chapters. Learning Objectives Objective one Objective two Objective three Key Terms Ipsum lorem, Phasellus, sollicitudin, finibus 16.1 Problems with data integration 16.1.1 Data types, sources, formats 16.1.2 Datums, extents, scales 16.1.3 Data resolutions 3.1 Integrating vector and raster data 16.2.1 Rasterization 16.2.2 Vectorization - Could make a cool little visualization showing how to go between the two. Either static images an animation, or video screen share. 16.2.5 Smoothing 16.2.6 Simplifying 3.2 Spatial data errors 3.2.1 Accuracy vs. Precision Measurement Errors Accuracy: The degree to which a set of measurements correctly matches the real world values. How close are we to the real value? If there is a consistent (systematic) offset from that real world value, our measurements are inaccurate. They have a bias. Precision: The degree of agreement between multiple measurements of the same real world phenomena. How repeatable is a measurement? If you take five measurements of the same feature, how likely are they to be similar? Lack of precision can be attributed to random errors. Source Source 3.2.2 Vaugeness and Ambiguity Vaugeness - Victoria  does it mean Victoria BC vs. Victoria AU Ambiguity - coastline - is it the high water line? Low water line? mean water level? 3.2.3 Quantifying spatial errors RMSE, Euclids distance 3.2.4 Logical Errors Ecological Fallacy, Atomistic Fallacy, MAUP etc. Its important to include these, whether here or elsewhere? 3.2.5 Other Errors? source data errors, out of date data, data entry &amp; digitization? :::: Case Study Large Scale Footprint mapping, temporal upscaling. Ill fill in more text here later, these figs are just grabbed from my thesis chapters. The gist of it - Measured NEE in one year. Have 10 years of climate data + Reanalysis data + satellite data. Combine these data sources &amp; train a model to do a temporal upscale/sensitivity analysis to see how inter-annual climate variability impacts NEE. Then do a landscape classification with a greenest pixel NDVI image, intersecting with the flux footprint. Use that to find the representative areas to do a back of the envelope spatial upscaling. Rough flowchart draft Reference map showing the Mackenzie Delta (Currently from chapter 2, Ill change it to a full delta NDVI map) Landscape classification and drone imagery Footprint NDVI profile Climate Data Temporally upscaled flux estimate Landscape classification based on fig 3 :::: Case Study Small Scale Case Study: UBC Trees in a Changing Climate The file structure for this case study doesnt match the structure of the template, so Ive left it out for now, until I can get a bit more guidance on it.
