Driven by the growing demand for relevant information about environmental change, great emphasis is placed on the creation of the next new satellite or a smaller, yet more powerful drone. Although innovation in these physical technologies is critical for the advancement of image collection, they dont guarantee that the imagery will be useful. In reality, the pixel values collected by a sensor are not purely the reflectance values from the surface of interest. Depending on the wavelengths being observed, there may be variations in the amount of photons emitted from the light source and a variety of atmospheric effects, such as scattering. There may also be slight inconsistencies in images collected by the same sensor on the same day or adjacent areas, which would affect the quality of analyses 4.2 Common Processing Steps 4.2.1 Geometric correction Relief displacement Orthorectification Georeferencing Georegistration Resampling Nearest neighbour Bilinear interpolation Cubic convolution 4.2.2 Atmospheric correction Atmospheric windows Clouds and shadows Scattering? Smoke and haze 4.2.3 Radiometric correction Conducted to calibrate and correct pixel values recorded by the sensor. This is required the values recorded by a sensor, called digital numbers, are a result of light interacting with the surface of reflectance and the atmosphere between the sensor. First, a calibration to change raw digital numbers into radiance, which removes the effects of the light source (solar irradiance/ wavelength Signal-to-noise Photon shot noise Pattern noise Readout noise Thermal noise Radiometric normalization Your turn! Practice questions relating to photon energy: demonstrate the higher frequency = higher energy higher wavelength = lower energy What is the section of the EMS in which humans can see? What is its approximate range? Case Study: Demo each resolution in relation to an image Case study title max of forty characters Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and entered into the bibliography. Avoid linking to external resources without a DOI and permanent URL. Contact Paul or try using the Leaflet package in R if you want to add an interactive web map. Your turn!: What is the ___ resolution of this image Ask the reader to undertake some activity or exercise. Have them explore data, an interactive tool, a web map.
