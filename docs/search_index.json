Driven by the growing demand for relevant information about environmental change, great emphasis is placed on the creation of the next new satellite or a smaller, yet more powerful drone. Although innovation in these physical technologies is critical for the advancement of image collection, they dont guarantee that the imagery will be useful. In reality, the pixel values collected by a sensor are not purely the reflectance values from the surface of interest. Depending on the wavelengths being observed, there may be variations in the amount of photons emitted from the light source and a variety of atmospheric effects, such as scattering. There may also be slight inconsistencies in images collected by the same sensor on the same day or adjacent areas, which would affect the quality of analyses 4.2 Common Processing Steps The collection of imagery presents a multitude of challenges, yet the act of gathering information represents only a portion of the issues remote sensing scientists face when conducting research. As discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, there are a variety of factors that can affect the radiation that a sensor observes and the location at which the sensor is directed. In this chapter we will discuss the methods used to prepare raw imagery for use in science. Before diving into the common steps used to render imagery scientifically useful, we will go over some key terms. First and foremost, image processing, or digital image analysis, refers to any actions taken to improve the accuracy of one or more component of raw imagery. In remote sensing science, the goal of image processing is to generate a product that provides accurate and useful information for scientific pursuit. This is in contrast to image processing for artistic purposes, which could include many similar steps, but focus on generating a product that is visually appealing. Noise is another common term associated with image processing and it refers to any element of the data that is not wanted. There are a variety of noise types, which we will discuss later. In contrast to noise, signal describes wanted components of the imagery. Combined, signal and noise provide guidance on what specific steps should be taken in relation to the data during image processing. Before they are addressed, however, it is also important to confirm the spatial accuracy of the data. 4.2.1 Geometric correction By definition, remotely sensed data is collected by a sensor at some distance apart from the object(s) being observed. In many instances, the sensor is in motion, and at the very least it is subject to influence from environmental actors like wind. Interactions with phenomena like wind can cause the instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to move slightly during data collection, introducing spatial errors to the imagery. On top of issues relating to sensor displacement, sensors in motion may also observe adjacent areas with different topographic properties. A combination of these two effects could be visualized by imagining an airplane flying over a forested hillside. As the sensor collects data the plane can be buffeted with wind, changing the direction of a sensors IFOV to an location that is not the original target. On top of issues with sensor movement, the elevation of the ground is constantly undulating, altering the distance at which the sensors observes the landscape below. These two issues that affect the spatial components of image collection compromise the accuracy of an image and need to be corrected. The general term used to refer to the spatial correction of an image is geometric correction. Relief displacement (Orthorectification?) The first component of geometric correction we will discuss deals with the terrain being observed. Changes in the terrain over which an image is collected lead to inconsistencies in the distances at which information is collected. These differences lead to objects in the image to appear in location inaccurate with reality. IS THIS NEEDED??? Georeferencing The removal of inaccuracies in the spatial location of an image can be conducted using a technique called georeferencing. The basic concept of georeferencing is to alter the coordinates of an image through the association of highly precise coordinates collected on site using a GPS. Coordinates collected in the field are often called ground points, and form the base of successful georeferencing. In general, increasing the amount and accuracy of ground points leads to increased spatial accuracy of the image. SPLINE, etc?? Georegistration (also georectification) Similar to georeferencing, georegistration involves adjusting the raw coordinates of an image to match more accurate ones. In the case of georegistration, however, ground points collected in the field are replaced with coordinates from a map or image that has been verified as spatially accurate. This method could be considered a matching of two products, enabling the two products to be analyzed together. An example would be matching two images collected one year apart. If the first image is georeferenced accurately the second image can simply be georegistered by identifying shared features, such as intersections or buildings, and linking them. Resampling Despite all the efforts to accurately place an image in space, it is likely that any spatial alterations also change the shape or alignment of the images pixels. Nearest neighbour Bilinear interpolation Cubic convolution 4.2.2 Atmospheric correction Atmospheric windows Clouds and shadows Scattering? Smoke and haze 4.2.3 Radiometric correction Conducted to calibrate and correct pixel values recorded by the sensor. This is required the values recorded by a sensor, called digital numbers, are a result of light interacting with the surface of reflectance and the atmosphere between the sensor. First, a calibration to change raw digital numbers into radiance, which removes the effects of the light source (solar irradiance/ wavelength Signal-to-noise Photon shot noise Pattern noise Readout noise Thermal noise Radiometric normalization Your turn!
