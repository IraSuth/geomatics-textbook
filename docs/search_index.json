In the previous chapter, we introduced how to represent the where on the earth an entity occurs inside a GIS. In this chapter we will introduce how we can describe what an entity is and when it occurs. Then we will cover how we use spatial data models to link the what and when to the where using spatial data models. Then we will wrap up by introducing some of the specific file types we use in GIS to represent spatial data. Learning Objectives Learn about the various scales we use to measure data Learn about spatial data models and how they work Learn about the different file types we use in GIS Key Terms Attribute, Qualitative, Quantitative, Vector, Raster 2.1 Attribute Data Spatial data is the foundation of Geographic Information Science, but spatial coordinates are meaningless unless they are linked with descriptive information about the location. Any non-spatial data relating to a spatial entity is known as an attribute. This non-spatial data can broadly be classified as either qualitative or quantitative. Data that is strictly descriptive and lacks any numeric quantity is qualitative. Data with numerical values that are separated by some meaningful interval is quantitative. The types of analysis we can conduct with qualitative data is more limited than quantitative data, but that does not necessarily mean quantitative is better than qualitative. From my lectures. IDK the original source, but itd be easy enough to just recreate my own. From my lectures. IDK the original source, but itd be easy enough to just recreate my own. 2.1.1 Nominal Quantitative data that just consists of a name/category with no ranking or direction is known as Nominal data. One category is not more or less, better or worse than another, they are just different. A good example would be flower types (see fig). Other examples would be zoning categories, colors, flavors of ice cream, place names, etc. The only arithmetic operations we can do with nominal data are checking for equality (True/False), count occurrences, and calculate the mode (most frequent occurrence).

A good example would be relative sizes (see fig). We can see Yarrow is taller than her sister Shamsa, so we can rank these dogs by height. However, we havent measured their heights, so we dont know how much taller Yarrow is than Shamsa. Some other good examples of Ordinal data include spice levels (mild, medium, hot), residential zoning density (low, medium, high), and survey responses. With ordinal data, we can do all operations we can do with nominal data, plus a few more. We can check the order/rank (greater than, less than) and in some circumstances we can calculate the median (see figure).

Related to ambiguity, is this the right place to talk about it?? 2.2 Quantitative 2.2.1 Interval Numeric scale, but the zero point is arbitrary * Time (3PM) * Dates (2021) * Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit) * 20 C is not twice as warm as 10 C 2.2.2 Log-Interval  necessary? 2.2.3 Ratio Numeric scale, zero point has physical meaning * Temperature (Kelvin/Rankine) * Height * Income * Housing cost * Population 2.2.4 Extensive Ratio 2.2.5 Cyclical Ratio 2.2.6 Derived Ratio I think all these can just be lumped in with Ratio Above^ 2.2.7 Counts . this is more an operation? Can be done to any data type? #### 3.1.10 Absolute 2.3 Types of numbers 2.3.1 Bits 2.3.2 Byte 2.3.3 Integer 2.3.4 Floating-point 2.4 Spatial data models 2.5 Vector data 2.5.1 Points 2.5.2 Lines 2.5.3 Polygons 2.6 Raster data 2.6.1 Cell data 2.6.2 Digital numbers 2.7 Triangulated Irregular Networks Case Study ::: Police Involved Deaths in Canada Ill fill this in later. Here is a link to the github org where Ill be hosting the data. Ill give an interactive map &amp; a brief discussion the data types used (nominal) ratio (police involved death rate and how they can be used together. I think this is a good example of how qualitative data and descriptor can be very useful. But its also super depressing. Your browser does not support iframes Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and entered into the bibliography. Avoid linking to external resources without a DOI and permanent URL.
